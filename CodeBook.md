Getting and Cleaning Data
=========================

*Code book for the data set used on the Course Project.*

The originals data sets (dTest & dTrain) were combined in the 'dAll' data set with the following structute:
'data.frame':	10299 obs. of  563 variables:
 $ SUB : int  2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
 $ LAB : int  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ...
 $ V1  : num  0.257 0.286 0.275 0.27 0.275 ...
 $ V2  : num  -0.0233 -0.0132 -0.0261 -0.0326 -0.0278 ...
 $ V3  : num  -0.0147 -0.1191 -0.1182 -0.1175 -0.1295 ...
...
 $ V561: num  0.04891 0.04982 0.05005 0.04081 0.02534
 
The 'SUB' variable concerning to individuals that participate of the research. The values range from 1 to 30.

'LAB' refers to the labels of activities measured:
1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

The variables from V1 to v561 refers to the measures taken. The codes description may be acessed listing the 'features' object 
generated by R script.

In the dTidy2 data set, were selected only variables concerning to means and standard deviations of the original data sets. 
The activities and variable names was labeled directly in the object and is present on the dTidy2.txt.
