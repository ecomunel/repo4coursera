Getting and Cleaning Data
=========================

The aim of this repository is share activities required by *"Getting and Cleaning Data Course"* taken on Coursera.

At this time, will be presented the final **Course Project**, trying demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The activity consists on the elaboration of a "R script" to work with data described on:
*http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones*

The script produced was called *run_analysis.R* and is avaiable on this repository.

The procedure involves the following steps:
* Download (if necessary) and read data sets
* Merges training + test sets (one data set)
* Extracts only mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Name the activities in the data set
* Labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

More details are described along the code using comments.

*You can download the code of script and test in your system!*

Look for **'run_analysis.R'** and **'BookCode.md'** files available in this repo.
